**Project: Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning**
About Me
Hello! I am Shreyash Upadhyay, a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE Core) at Galgotias University. I am passionate about applying machine learning and data science techniques to solve real-world problems. My experience spans across building predictive models, data analysis, and developing efficient solutions using machine learning algorithms.

**Project Overview**
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis Model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. The model is trained and tested using the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset, which contains a large number of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in each review. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a review based on its textual content.

**Contributions**
Data Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed by cleaning the text, removing stopwords, and converting the reviews into a suitable format for training the model. I used techniques like tokenization, stemming, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF) to prepare the text data.

**Model Implementation: I implemented a machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn to classify the reviews. The model was trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set.

**Model Evaluation: The model’s performance was evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to ensure its effectiveness in sentiment classification.

**Visualization: I used visualization techniques to display the distribution of positive and negative reviews, and presented the model’s performance using confusion matrices and classification reports.

**Technologies Used**
.Python
.scikit-learn for machine learning
.pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
.matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
.NLTK for natural language processing
